# MDI220_Project
This is the code for my MDI 220 project, a second-year course at Télécom Paris. This course, entitled "Statistics", covers the concepts of models, estimators, point estimation (maximum likelihood, method of moments), quadratic risk, Cramer-Rao bound, decision procedures, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals and Bayesian methods.
